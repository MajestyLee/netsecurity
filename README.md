homework1c for netwrok security  
I put this homework in the lab_1c  
in the dir called lab_1_Packet,  
ConvertAnswer.py,RequestConvert.py,Result.py are three packet types in hw1a.  
hw1c_server.py is for the server protocol  
hw1c_client.py is for the client protocol

the dir called "test_example" is created for the test for write the UDP,TCP protocol which learnt from Python Documentation.  

homework1d for network security  
I put this homework in the lab_1d  
hw1d_server.py is for the server protocol
hw1d_client.py is for the client protocol  
hw1d.py is for the playground test, it is ok
python3 hw1d.py server (start server)
python3 hw1d.py 20174.1.1.1 (start client)
then, you can input "request" to send the first request,which in the hw1a,client sent the server the request  
when the server get the request, it return the ROMAN number  
then you can input the answer
